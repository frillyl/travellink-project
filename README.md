# About Project
Indonesia is one of the most popular vacation destinations for tourists. One of the most common problems faced by tourists is the difficulty in finding places that match their interests in the city they are visiting. So, how can we solve this problem so that tourists can enjoy their vacation in Indonesia?

TRAVELLINK aims to help users find access to information on tourist attractions that match their interests in the city they are visiting. They can select and plan tourist categories such as historical places, amusement parks, and others. In addition, we also provide a feature to sort them by ranking and estimated ticket prices to be paid.
